Comment: cmake doesn't detect any flags correctly so we have to pass
  the flags from pkg-config by hand.
  Also openjpeg's internal library sources are broken so we cannot
  use BUILD_THIRDPARTY:BOOL=ON to work around it.
  Note that the library itself doesn't use dependencies, but the tools
  do so for now we opt to build the tools and thus need the libraries.
