Package: openjpeg
Version: 2.5.0
Build-system: cmake
Source.URL: https://github.com/uclouvain/openjpeg/archive/v${ver}.tar.gz
Comment: cmake doesn't detect any flags correctly so we have to pass
  the flags from pkg-config by hand.
  Also openjpeg's internal library sources are broken so we cannot
  use BUILD_THIRDPARTY:BOOL=ON to work around it.
  Note that the library itself doesn't use dependencies, but the tools
  do so for now we opt to build the tools and thus need the libraries.
Depends: tiff, libpng
Configure: --prefix=/${prefix} -DCMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS="`pkg-config --static --libs libtiff-4`" -DCMAKE_C_FLAGS="`pkg-config --cflags libtiff-4`"
